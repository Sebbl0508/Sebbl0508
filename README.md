# Hello :wave:
My name's Sebastian

## Programming languages i use
### Most knowledge

    - Sometimes also for embedded projects
- `C`: For embedded applications -> Microcontrollers like `Arduino`, `ESP32` or `RP2040`

### Semi-known
- `Python`: Mostly for quick scripts or also web backends
- `TypeScript`: For web-frontends

### Basic knowledge
- `CSS`
- `C++`: I use it like C with classes

## Technologies i use
- `Docker` & `Docker-Compose`

## Interests
### Game-engine development
I like learning about low-level game development with APIs like **Vulkan** & **[wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu)**

### Microcontrollers & low-level development
I experiment programming microncontrollers like the `RP2040`, `ESP32` or boards from the Arduino family with `C` and `Rust`
